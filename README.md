# README-Generator
This project uses a combination of Node.js, Javascript, and the Inquirer and Axios packages to write a program that takes user input and generates a README.md to start a repository with. The users github user name is taken as input and used to call the github api for account related information such as a link to their github profile, their picture/avatar, and email. If email information is not available in the response from Githubs api "Email not available from api" will be displayed in its place. A badge is also generated with the license selected by the user, and a link to that license is also included. The rest of the user input is displayed in the newly generated readme with a table of contents as well for easy accessability.
