# README-Generator
This project uses a combination of Node.js, Javascript, and the Inquirer and Axios node packages to write a program that takes user input and generates a README.md, example of the output can be seen in "exampleReadMe.md" file in this repository. The users github user name is taken as input and used to call the github api for account related information such as a link to their github profile, their picture/avatar, and email. If email information is not available in the response from Github's api "Email not available from api" will be displayed in its place. A badge is also generated with the license selected by the user, and a link to that license is also included. The rest of the user input is displayed in the newly generated readme with a table of contents as well for easy accessability.
